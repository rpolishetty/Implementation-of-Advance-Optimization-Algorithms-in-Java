# Implementation-of-Advance-Optimization-Algorithms-in-Java
  
Notes:
  1. Four Search Strategies are used to find the solution. These are BreadthFirst Search, DepthFirst Search, Greedy Best First Search A*      Search Algorithms 
  2. To test different test cases just change the name of test file under main() function
  3. To implement Different Search algorithm. Uncomment desired algorithm and comment all other search algorithm under main() function

Designed the solutions for testing efficiency. Analyzed and compared space & time complexities and path cost.  Optimality of algorithms have been accounted for several path finding scenarios. Technologies used: Java
